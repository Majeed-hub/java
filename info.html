        ex Mode wq : Write and quit (save and exit). w fileName : Write to file
        called fileName (save as). Searching and Replacing in (ex Mode): vi also
        has powerful search and replace capabilities. The formal syntax for
        searching is: :s/string Block delete commands in (x mode): need to press
